TODO LIST:
  - Narrowed down the 404/500 errors: Controller2 is not properly forming clustering with Controller1
        - MariaDB is failing to allow connections on Controller2 thus causing the openslack client to report 500
        - 404s were due to service publicURL not populating, probably cause by MariaDB refusing connections
  - Compute nodes now register, however AMQ is reporting that the connect gets closed every minute or so
        - Mostlikely issue with HAProxy or TCP Keepalive (take PCAP)


  - Deploy Network
  - Dashboard
  - Integrate with current GlusterFS
      - Need to add SSD/SAS to Gluster
